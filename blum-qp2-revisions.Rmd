(sec = section, p. = page, l. = line, ex. = example):
\newline
\newline \textbf{throughout the paper:} change "adjacent" to "successive" when referring to features, remove "adjacent" when referring to vowels, remove reference to concatenation after sec2.2 (ok when adding morpheme boundary for Turkish)
\newline \textbf{sec1: p.1, l.11} reword first sentence to clarify analysis of vh as phonotactic restriction, only surface ARs. \textbf{l.16} avoid derivational wording "vowel harmony patterns utilize..."
\newline \textbf{sec1.1: p.3, l.111-119} add paragraph explicitly defining use of terms: assimilation, spreading, agreement "However, in this paper...". \textbf{p.4, l.133} fix spelling of "analysis"
\newline \textbf{sec2.2: p.6, l.171} change "one element on a feature" to "one element on each feature tier".
\newline \textbf{sec2.3: p.8, l.239} add "used to define r$_1$-r$_n$" to clarify what the constraint definition language is. \textbf{l.243-244} change "is thus a conjunction of surface markedness constraints" to "thus consists of the set of surface markedness constraints"
\newline \textbf{sec2.4: p.8, l.258-271} rearrange paragraph to explain previous account of assimilation process then explain terms with respect to surface representations. \textbf{p.9, l.273, ex.9} remove example 9b that shows concatenation and paragraph describing it
\newline \textbf{p.12, l.364-365} reword sentence to define locality "Here locality means...". \textbf{l.366} fix spelling of "adjacent"
\newline \textbf{sec3.2: p.15, l.430, ex.20} change example to show that disagreement across transparent vowel is ungrammatical. \textbf{l.423} add mention of successor relation between back features. \textbf{l.427} change "certain back features" to "-back features". \textbf{l.429-435} Explain how FSCs enforce +back agreement. \textbf{l.441} remove "it satisfies FS, the NCC, and the OCP". \textbf{l.443-446} add sentence explaining that ex.20b shows that disagreement across transparent vowel is ungrammatical
\newline \textbf{sec.3.2.1: p.16, l.460} change "adjacent to a" to "in a successor relation with the intervening". \textbf{l.464-465, ex.21} change example to shorter word with multiple transparent vowels. \textbf{l.477-479} split sentences so final sentence says "Thus Finnish vowel harmony demonstrates surface agreement and can be considered local"
\newline \textbf{sec.4.1: p.18, l.508} delete "For example". \textbf{p.18. l.532} add "in a successor relation with each other". \textbf{l.565, ex.29} remove concatenation example. \textbf{p.20, l.568-577} change wording from "vowel closest to boundary" to "second vowel", clarify that back harmony holds between vowels in diff suffixes and between root-final and a suffix vowel, add "with two suffixes" at end of paragraph. \textbf{p.22, l.620-622} add prediction of polysyllabic disharmonic suffixes
\newline \textbf{sec.4.1.1: p.22, l.627; p.23, l.640, 643} change "adjacency" to "the successor relation". \textbf{p.23, l.645} clarify "each language determines which primitives it makes use of". \textbf{l.652} change that "Finnish uses ... primitives with morpheme boundary on segmental tier" to "Finnish does not utilize morpheme boundary primitives"
\newline \textbf{sec5.1: p.24, l.681} change "initial vowel" to "initial -low vowel". \textbf{l.685} add "Following ex. 37" to connect ARs with transformation example. \textbf{p.24, l.688-690, ex.37} change input of Akan and SG examples. \textbf{p.26, l.726, ex.41} change [e] to [\textipa{E}] and switch ATR feature values to make vowel feature representations accurate. \textbf{p.27, l.748, ex.44} switch ATR feature values, change [e] to [\textipa{E}], and switch red ATR association line from first [\textipa{I}] to last one, make association between first [\textipa{I}] and -low black
